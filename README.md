This code accompanies the peer-reviewed manuscript _Maasakkers, J. D., et al., A gridded inventory of 2012-2018 U.S. anthropogenic methane emissions, ES&T (2023)_ [[link]](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.est.3c05138). This product is an update to gridded methane GHGIv1, described previously in _Maasakkers et al. (2016)_ [[link]](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.6b02878).

## Background
The gridded EPA U.S. anthropogenic methane greenhouse gas inventory (gridded methane GHGI) includes spatially and temporally resolved (gridded) maps of annual anthropogenic methane emissions (0.1°×0.1°) for the contiguous United States (CONUS). Total gridded methane emissions for each emission source sector are consistent with national annual U.S. anthropogenic methane emissions reported in the _U.S. EPA Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks_ [[link]](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/inventory-us-greenhouse-gas-emissions-and-sinks) (U.S. GHGI).

This code produces the main gridded GHGI v2, which includes gridded annual U.S. anthropogenic methane emissions for 2012-2018 for 26 source categories. This dataset is developed to be consistent with the national U.S. GHGI published in 2020 (_U.S. EPA, Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990 - 2020. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2020, EPA 430-R-22-003_) [[link]](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/inventory-us-greenhouse-gas-emissions-and-sinks-1990-2018)

This code also extends the version 2 methodology to produce 2012-2020 gridded methane emissions consistent with the 2022 U.S. GHGI. In this process, the source-specific spatial patterns from the 2012-2018 are used to downscale more recent national methane emission estimates from the 2022 GHGI Report.

Final gridded data are available on Zenodo: https://zenodo.org/records/8367082

## Code & Repository Overview

The gridded GHGI (v2 and express extension) code is written in Python in Jupyter Notebooks. Each sector-based script is designed to read in sector-specific U.S. national emissions from the 2020 GHGI Report and allocate those emissions to a CONUS grid using available spatial information in the underlying inventory activity datasets. These datasets are not provided in the public version of this repository. References to the relevant data sources are provided in the _Maasakkers et. al., (2023)(https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.est.3c05138)_ manuscript. Some of these underlying spatial proxy datasets include proprietary information. Others are available upon request. 


### Repository Contents

#### Code
This repository includes:
- /code/GEPA_2022_Supplement - includes a Jupyter Notebook for the express extension for Natural Gas Post-Meter Emissions
- /code/Global_Functions - includes global functions used across all sector-specific Jupyter Notebooks.
- /code/Final_Gridded_Data/ - folder where the annual source-specific methane flux files are output.
- /code/File_Processing/ - folder that contains the scripts to process the source-specific raw output flux files, into annual flux files published to the Zenodo repository
- /code/...  - each folder corresponds to an inventory source category, including the Jupyter Notebooks for both the main v2 and the express extension
